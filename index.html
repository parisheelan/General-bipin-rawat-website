        <h1 id="about">ABOUT</h1>
        <p>General Bipin Rawat (16 March 1958 – 8 December 2021) was an Indian military officer who was a four-star
            general of the Indian Army. He served as the first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) of the Indian Armed Forces
            from January 2020 until his death in a helicopter crash in December 2021. Prior to taking over as the CDS,
            he served as the 57th and last Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee as well as 26th Chief of Army Staff
            of the Indian Army.
        </p>
        <h1 id="early">EARLY LIFE</h1>
        <p>Bipin Rawat was born in Pauri town of Pauri Garhwal district, modern-day Uttarakhand state, on 16 March 1958.
            His family had been serving in the Indian Army for multiple generations. His father Lakshman Singh Rawat
            (1930–2015) was from Sainj village of the Pauri Garhwal district; commissioned into 11 Gorkha Rifles in
            1951, he retired as Deputy Chief of the Army Staff in 1988 as a lieutenant-general. His mother was from the
            Uttarkashi district and was the daughter of Kishan Singh Parmar, the ex-Member of the Legislative Assembly
            (MLA) from Uttarkashi.

            Rawat attended Cambrian Hall School in Dehradun and St. Edward's School in Shimla. He then joined the
            National Defence Academy, Khadakwasla and the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, from where he graduated
            first in the order of merit and was awarded the 'Sword of Honour'.

            Rawat was also a graduate of the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC), Wellington and the Higher Command
            Course at the United States Army Command and General Staff College (USACGSC) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in
            1997. From his tenure at the DSSC, he obtained an MPhil degree in Defence Studies as well as diplomas in
            Management and Computer Studies from the University of Madras. In 2011, he was awarded a honorary doctorate
            by CCS University, Meerut for his research on military-media strategic studies
        </p>
        <h1 id="work">WORK</h1>
        <p> Early career
            Rawat was commissioned into the 5th battalion, the 11 Gorkha Rifles (5/11 GR) on 16 December 1978, the same
            unit as his father.

            During the 1987 Sino-Indian skirmish in the Sumdorong Chu valley, then Captain Rawat's battalion was
            deployed against the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The standoff was the first military confrontation
            along the disputed McMahon Line after the 1962 war.

            He has much experience in high-altitude warfare and spent ten years conducting counter-insurgency
            operations. He commanded a company in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir as a major. As a colonel, he commanded his
            battalion, the 5th battalion, the 11 Gorkha Rifles, in the eastern sector along the Line of Actual Control
            at Kibithu. Promoted to the rank of brigadier, he commanded 5 Sector of Rashtriya Rifles in Sopore.

            UN mission in Congo
            Rawat commanded MONUSCO (a Multinational Brigade in a Chapter VII mission in the Democratic Republic of the
            Congo). Within two weeks of deployment in the DRC, the Brigade faced a major offensive in the east which
            threatened the regional capital of North Kivu, Goma. The offensive also threatened to destabilise the
            country as a whole. The situation demanded a rapid response and North Kivu Brigade was reinforced, where it
            was responsible for over 7,000 men and women, representing nearly half of the total MONUSCO force. Whilst
            simultaneously engaged in offensive kinetic operations against the CNDP and other armed groups, Rawat (then
            Brigadier) carried out tactical support to the Congolese Army (FARDC), He sensitization programmes with the
            local population and detailed coordination to ensure that all were informed about the situation and worked
            together in the progress of operations. He was responsible for the protection of the vulnerable population.

            This operational period lasted for four months. Goma never fell, the East stabilized and the main armed
            group was motivated to the negotiating table and has since been integrated into the FARDC. He was also
            tasked to present the Revised Charter of Peace Enforcement to the Special Representatives of the
            Secretary-General and Force Commanders of all the UN missions in a special conference at Wilton Park,
            London, on 16 May 2009. Rawat was twice awarded the Force Commander’s Commendation.

            General officer
            After promotion to major general, Rawat took over as the General Officer Commanding 19th Infantry Division
            (Uri). As a lieutenant general, he commanded III Corps, headquartered in Dimapur, before taking over the
            Southern Army in Pune.

            He also held staff assignments which included an instructional tenure at the Indian Military Academy
            (Dehradun), General Staff Officer Grade 2 at the Military Operations Directorate, logistics staff officer of
            a Re-organised Army Plains Infantry Division (RAPID) in central India, Colonel Military Secretary and Deputy
            Military Secretary in the Military Secretary’s Branch and Senior Instructor in the Junior Command Wing. He
            also served as the Major General General Staff (MGGS) of the Eastern Command.

        <h1 id="achievements">Avhievements</h1>
        <p>During his career of nearly 43 years, he was awarded
